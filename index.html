            <p>As first generation immigrants from the Philippines, my parents had to work extra hard to humbly live in Canada. What's amazing is that they managed to give our family the opportunities to travel all around the world over the years. As their daughter, I will forever be grateful to all the sights they have allowed me to see.<br> <br> Despite loving everywhere we went, these are my favourite places where I would love to visit once again. All images belong to me.</p>

                <p class="p1">Up first we have Cancun. Cancun is a city in Mexico brewing with rich Mayan history and has many tourist attractions that are sought to be viewed by people all over the world. One of the many great tourist attractions you can visit in Cancun is the Chichén Itzá, which is a complex of Mayan ruins. The name Chichén Itzá translates to “at the mouth of the well of Itzaes”, which comes from a Mayan phrase. Other places to visit in Cancun include the Playa Delfines, Ventura park, and many ancient Mayan archeological sites. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Tourism-g150807-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula-Vacations.html">Click here to learn more about Cancun!</a></p>

            <h3 class="sectiontitle">London</h3>
            <figure>
                <p id="p2">Secondly, we have the cloudy and proud capital of England is London. With it’s rich history, there’s always something to learn especially with the help of its many museums such as The British Museum, Natural History Museum and the National Gallery. If you’re a fan of Tom Cruise, you might’ve heard of “The Mummy (2017)” directed by Alex Kurtzman. This movie contained lots of scenes taking place in the Natural History Museum. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/London">Click here to learn more about London!</a></p>

            <h3 class="sectiontitle">Singapore</h3>

                <img src="images/singapore.jpg" id="img">
                <p class="p1">Lastly, we have the humid and populous city-state of Singapore which is home to many beautiful sights. You might’ve heard of the movie “Crazy Rich Asians” directed by Jon M. Chu. This movie is largely filmed in Singapore. This film entertainingly showcases Singapore's influence and wealth which is accurate in the real world. <br> <br> More on my own experiences in Singapore, as stated before, Singapore is HUMID. My skin had melanated in three tones and my mood was groggy. Nonetheless, it was a very fun experience. <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/singapore">Click here to learn more about Singapore!</a> </p>
